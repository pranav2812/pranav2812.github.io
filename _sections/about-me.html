<p> I'm currently a third year undergraduate student at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay pursuing a major in Civil Engineering and minor in Computer Science Engineering. I love to innovate things. Computer vision, Machine learning, robotics and AI are my major fields of interest. My learning experience includes courses in control systems, machine learning, computer vision, design of structures, relevant lab courses and hands - on projects.</p>
